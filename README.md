# Optimal antimicrobial dosing combinations when drug-resistance mutation rates differ

This code accompanies our paper by the same name, by me, Oscar Delaney, and my supervisors [Jan Engelstaedter](https://github.com/JanEngelstaedter) and [Andrew Letten](https://github.com/andrewletten).

We implement a mathematical and computational model of AMR evolution, and show that knowledge of relative mutation rates can meaningfully inform the optimal deployment of two drugs in a combination treatment regimen. Under plausible assumptions there is a linear relationship in log-log space between the optimal ratio of doses between two drugs A and B and the ratio of their mutation rates. This power law relationship holds for bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs.

We implement our simulations in R, and also perform analytic approximations in Mathematica.
